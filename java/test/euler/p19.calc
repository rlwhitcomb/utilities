/*
 * Problem 19 from Project Euler (projecteuler.net)
 *
 * Counting Sundays
 *
 * You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.
 *
 *    1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
 *    Thirty days has September,
 *    April, June and November.
 *    All the rest have thirty-one,
 *    Saving February alone,
 *    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
 *    And on leap years, twenty-nine.
 *    A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
 *
 * How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
