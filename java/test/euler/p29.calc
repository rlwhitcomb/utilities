/*
 * Problem 29 from Project Euler (projecteuler.net)
 *
 * Distinct powers
 *
 * Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5:
 *
 *   2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32
 *   3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243
 *   4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024
 *   5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125
 *
 * If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
 *
 *   4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125
 *
 * How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by a^b for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?
