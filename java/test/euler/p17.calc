/*
 * Problem 17 from Project Euler (projecteuler.net)
 *
 * Number letter counts
 *
 * If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
 *
 * If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
 *
 * NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen)
 * contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
