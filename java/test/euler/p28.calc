 * Problem 28 from Project Euler (projecteuler.net)
 *
 * Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
 *
 *        21 22 23 24 25
 *        20  7  8  9 10
 *        19  6  1  2 11
 *        18  5  4  3 12
 *        17 16 15 14 13
 *
 * It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
 *
 * What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?

 * The values on the diagonals can be easily computed for a given (odd) size as follows:
 * - upper right = size¬≤
 * - upper left = upper right - (size - 1)
 * - lower left = upper left - (size - 1)
 * - lower right = lower left - (size - 1)
 *
 * Which gives us a formula to quickly and easily compute the values at each size ùëõ:
 *   sum = 4ùëõ¬≤ - 6ùëõ + 6
 *
 * @param size The (odd) size (3..limit) of the square.
 * @return     Sum of the diagonals at that size.
