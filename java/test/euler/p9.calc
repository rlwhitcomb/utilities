 * Problem 9 from Project Euler (projecteuler.net)
 *
 * Special Pythagorean triplet
 *
 * A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
 *
 *     a**2 + b**2 = c**2
 *
 * For example, 3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
 *
 * There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
 * Find the product abc.
