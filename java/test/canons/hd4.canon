>  1: Psalm 23
>  2: 
>  3: The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
>  4: He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
>  5: He resoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righeousness for his name's sake.
>  6: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
>  7: Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
>  8: Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
