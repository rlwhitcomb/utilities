>>  If you specify the "-c" flag the output will have all the lines
>>    of the file(s) concatenated (using commas) into a single line.
>>
>>  The "-j" flag is similar except the lines will be joined by a
>>    single space between each into a single line.
>>
>>  Without either of these options, the input file will be deconstructed
>>    into one element per line and the commas (if any) will be removed.
>>
>>  The "-x nn" option will cut the nn number of characters (if present)
>>    from the start of each input line (useful for "svn st" output).
>>
>>  Using "-b" without "-c" will print a blank line between
>>    each output value, while with "-c" will put a blank after
>>    each comma.
>>
>>  Using "-l" will print newlines after each entry, even with "-c"
>>
>>  The "-nnn" option (where "nnn" is a number from 1 to 255) specifies
>>    a maximum line width for the "-c" output mode.
>>
>>  The "-n" option simply counts the number of entries in the input
>>    using the rules from the other options and outputs the number of entries.
>>
>>  The "-w" option will recognize input files where the input
>>    values are separated by whitespace instead of ",".
>>
>>  The "-e prefix_text" and "-f postfix_text" options will add this text
>>    before (after) the single line or each line of the output.
>>
>>  The "-s" option will join the whole file into a single string without
>>    changing anything else.
>>
>>  The "-u" option will do nothing to the input except do any cutting specified,
>>    and add the prefix or postfix text to each line.
>>
>>  The "-i nn" option will indent each line by nn tab/space characters.
>>
>>  Using "@" or nothing for the list_file_name will read from stdin.
>>  Multiple file names are allowed as well as mixing "@" with regular
>>    file names, which will simply read and concatenate everything together.
>>
>>  Unless the "-o output_file" option is given, all output will be sent to
>>    stdout. This output file option is preferable when reading from the console.
>>
>>  Use "-help" (or "-h" or "-?") to display this help text.
>>  Use "-version" (or "-vers", "-ver", or "-v" to display version information.)
