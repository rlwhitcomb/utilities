#
# M = P[r(1+r)^n/((1+r)^n)-1)]
#
#  M = the total monthly mortgage payment
#  P = the principal loan amount
#  r = your monthly interest rate. Lenders provide you an annual rate
#      so you’ll need to divide that figure by 12 (the number of month
#      in a year) to get the monthly rate. If your interest rate is 5%,
#      your monthly rate would be 0.004167 (0.05/12=0.004167).
#  n = number of payments over the loan’s lifetime. Multiply the number
#      of years in your loan term by 12 (the number of months in a year)
#      to get the number of total payments for your loan. For example,
#      a 30-year fixed mortgage would have 360 payments (30x12=360).

# The context for the payment calculation is:
#   P = full principal amount to be financed
#   R = yearly interest rate (%)
#   N = number of years
# Then the calculated values are:
#   r = monthly interest as a decimal value (% / 100 / 12)
#   n = number of months (years * 12)
