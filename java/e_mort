#
# M = P[r(1+r)^n/((1+r)^n)-1)]
#
#  M = the total monthly mortgage payment
#  P = the principal loan amount
#  r = your monthly interest rate. Lenders provide you an annual rate
#      so you’ll need to divide that figure by 12 (the number of month
#      in a year) to get the monthly rate. If your interest rate is 5%,
#      your monthly rate would be 0.004167 (0.05/12=0.004167).
#  n = number of payments over the loan’s lifetime. Multiply the number
#      of years in your loan term by 12 (the number of months in a year)
#      to get the number of total payments for your loan. For example,
#      a 30-year fixed mortgage would have 360 payments (30x12=360).

# grammar is PMT obj
# where "obj" has P, r or R, n or N
# where r = monthly rate, R = yearly rate
#   and n = months, N = years
