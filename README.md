# utilities
Some of my personal utility programs, collected over a number of years. Most were developed to be useful to me in my own programming, and so may be useful to others.

## bat
Useful Windows batch files/programs.

## c
C programs for use on the command line.

## java
Java command line programs. Many of the latest are translations from C to Java to be useful on multiple platforms.

## pivot
GUI programs based on the Apache Pivot™ platform.



# Building

The C programs are so old that they were originally built on 32-bit Windows / MS-DOS, and I have no idea whether they even build with the latest Visual Studio. Almost none are useful on non-WIndows platforms. I am in the process of converting the most useful ones to Java anyway.

The Java programs build certainly with Java 8, and also build with Java 11 on OSX (and probably later), but do require close to the latest Apache Ant™ version (1.10.x).  The Apache Pivot™ based programs need the trunk version of the Apache Pivot code (post 2.0.5).
